I am Recep. I graduated from Electrical and Electronics Engineering and doing my master's degree in ICT Cybersystems in Italy, Padova. My thesis is Network Intrusion Systems with Machine Learning, and I will graduate in July 2022.üè´
Being passionate about my job, I enjoy learning and applying my knowledge.  I have learned C and still learning Python. From my bachelor's degree I experienced many cards such as Arduino, STM32, Raspberry, FPGA, PLC. 

üå± I am currently learning in Ethical Hacking and Computer Vision.

‚ú®My journey so far:‚ú®

üî≠ **Electronics:** I did projects with microcontrollers such as Arduino and STM32. IoT and robotics projects at university and as a hobby. For 4 years in my bachelor's degree, I was always trying to do some projects with electronics.

üî≠ **Master's degree:** I learned Network Intrusion Detection Systems, Web applications, databases, and networking. I learned Linux, be more familiar with operating systems and become comfortable with the command line.

üî≠ **Artificial Intelligence:** I took 3 online courses and I built many ML models with datasets from Kaggle (Python, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit learn) and one additional project classification of Internet Users with ANN.  And for computer vision, I used YoloV4 to learn.

üî≠ **Cybersecurity:** I started to learn from a master's degree course called "Internet". I learned many things about Networking, theory, and building networks in labs. And I took an Ethical Hacking online course, learned many things about hacking, and did practically using Virtual machines, virtual Windows 10, Kali Linux, and Metasploit.

‚ö° I love tennis, camping, travelling and nature!
