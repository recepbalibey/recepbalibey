- **BSc: Electrical and Electronics Engineering** <br>
ðŸ”­ **Bachelor's Degree Thesis** - Real-Time Object Detection with TensorFlow and Mobile Application Design: It is aimed to provide visually impaired individuals with ease in their daily lives with this project. The designed device takes the photo by pressing the button of the user and recognizes the user with the artificial intelligence algorithm working on the server in the photo, and transmits the number and number of objects by means of headphones or speakers. <br>
- **MSc: ICT for Internet and Multimedia, Cybersystems**<br>
ðŸ”­ **Master's Degree Thesis** - Network Intrusion Control System Solutions Leveraging Machine Learning: focused on improving intrusion detection systems (IDS) through 'Delta Labeling,' a novel method using cloned machine pairs to accurately label malicious network traffic flows. 

I learned C as my first programming language in 2016 and still learning Python and others for fun. With my bachelor's degree, I experienced many cards such as Arduino, STM32, Raspberry, FPGA, and PLC. During my master's degree, I experienced Linux, Networking fundamentals, Databases, Web Applications, Data Science Applications, and Ethical Hacking Subjects.


ðŸŒ± I am currently learning & improving & working in Cybersecurity field. I would like to focus on AI security in the future.

<h2>My journey so far</h2>

ðŸ”­ **Electronics:** I did IoT and robotics projects with Arduino and STM32. <br>
ðŸ”­ **Master's degree:** I learned Network Intrusion Detection Systems, Web applications, Machine learning, Databases, and Networking. I learned Linux, became more familiar with operating systems, and became comfortable with the command line.<br>
ðŸ”­ **Artificial Intelligence:** I took online courses and I built many ML models with datasets from Kaggle (Python, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit learn). And for computer vision, I used YoloV4 to learn.<br>
ðŸ”­ **Cybersecurity:** I started to learn from a master's degree course called "Internet". I learned many things about Networking, theory, and building networks in labs. I took an Ethical Hacking online course and learned many things about hacking, and used Virtual machines to simulate a hacking environment. I worked professionally in a couple of companies and still working and improving. <br>

Some titles from the career:
- Tutor <br>
- Electrical Engineer Intern <br>
- Electronics Engineer Intern <br>
- Quality Assurance Engineer (focused on Unified Threat Management(UTM) Device Testing (AV, OpenVPN, IDS-IPS, Content Filtering, Proxy) <br>
- IT Security Engineer (focused on mainly network security) <br>
- System Security Engineer (focused on platform security - avionics) <br>
