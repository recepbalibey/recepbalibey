I am Recep. I graduated from Electrical and Electronics Engineering and completed my master's degree in ICT Cybersystems in Italy, Padova. My thesis was Network Intrusion Systems with Machine Learning.  
I have learned C as my first programming language in 2016 and still learning Python and others for fun. From my bachelor's degree I experienced many cards such as Arduino, STM32, Raspberry, FPGA, PLC. During my master's degree, I experienced Linux, Networking fundametals, Databases, Web Applications, Data Science Applications, Ethical Hacking Subjects. 

ðŸŒ± I am currently learning & improving myself in Cybersecurity field.

âœ¨My journey so far:âœ¨

ðŸ”­ **Electronics:** I did IoT and robotics projects with Arduino and STM32. For 4 years in my bachelor's degree, I was always trying to do some projects with electronics and enjoyed learning it a lot.

ðŸ”­ **Master's degree:** I learned Network Intrusion Detection Systems, Web applications, Machine learning, Databases, and Networking. I learned Linux, be more familiar with operating systems and become comfortable with the command line.

ðŸ”­ **Artificial Intelligence:** I took 3 online courses and I built many ML models with datasets from Kaggle (Python, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit learn). And for computer vision, I used YoloV4 to learn.

ðŸ”­ **Cybersecurity:** I started to learn from a master's degree course called "Internet". I learned many things about Networking, theory, and building networks in labs. And I took an Ethical Hacking online course, learned many things about hacking, and did practically using Virtual machines, virtual Windows 10, Kali Linux, and Metasploit. I am planning to continue learning with IBM, Cisco, VulnHub. 

âš¡ I love tennis, camping, football, travelling and nature!
